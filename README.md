## WORKFLOW

#### ISSUES
___________

We will be making issue templates:
* idea
* hotfix / improvement
* question  

> You are always allowed to make a new issue with a new idea / bug / improvement / question, however, add the awaiting approval label to the issue.


#### SPRINTS
____________

From now on we will be working with sprints, this will ensure more structure in the project. Each sprint will take 2 weaks.
The sprint will always end on a Friday and start on a Saturday. Every second Friday we will decide what issues will be added to the following sprint.

#### WORKDAYS
_____________

Working on Fridays is still required, but the time will be moved from *18:00* to *19:00*  
We will be picking up the speed however. So you are not required to work extra days.
You are however obligated to finish the issues you are assigned to in the sprint.
If you are not able to work on Fridays due to appointments other then Seaqull give us a heads up. Preferably 1 week in advance.
If you are sick or any other reasons like a relatives decease, just tell us in discord. We are not heartless and we will understand

#### PULL REQUEST
_________________

We will be making a template for pull requests. It is required to follow this template. This will make sure it is easy to review.
So we spend less time on reviewing and more on coding. Don't forget to label your pull request.
You are **never** allowed to merge your own pull request. This way we keep the quality of our code high.
