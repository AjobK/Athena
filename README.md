## WORKFLOW

#### ISSUES
___________

I will be making issue templates:
* idea
* hotfix / improvement
* question  

When making your issue it should follow one of these templates. If you think your issue is done and ready for the next sprint.
Please tag @vQFire I will then review your issue and check if it follows the template.
I *won't* be checking if it is relevant, that will be done we plan our next sprint.
Only with my approval your issue will be able to enter the next sprint. It will be labeld when it is approved.

#### SPRINTS
____________

From now on we will be working with sprints, this will ensure more structure in the project. Each sprint will take 2 weaks.
The sprint will always end on a Friday and start on a Saturday. Each Friday we will decide what issues will be used for the coming sprint.
I have an idea for picking issues without to much discussions.  
It goes like this:
* Each member gets 5 points.
* Each member can spend his points on issues to the ones they think are usefull.
* Then the top 5 issues are picked and used for the next sprint.
* Then each issue will be distributed among the members
* You can lose and earn points. Explained in the workdays section

Like I said this is an expirament, if it does not work we will try something else.
You are allowed to work on an issues for multiple sprints. This needs to be requested within 3 days from starting the sprint.

#### WORKDAYS
_____________

Working on Fridays is still required, but the time will be moved from *18:00* to *19:00*  
We will be picking up the speed however. So you are not required to work extra days.
You are however obligated to finish the issues you have been assigned in the sprint.
When you are not able to finish your sprint you will lose one of you points when picking the next issues for the sprints.
You can earn one by completing you sprint (max: 5 points).  
If you are not able to work on Fridays due to appointments other then Seaqull give us a heads up. Preferably 1 week in advance.
If you are sick or any other reasons like a relatives decease, just tell us in dicord we'll understand

#### PULL REQUEST
_________________

I will be making a template for pull requests. It is required to follow this template. This will make sure it is easy to review.
So we spend less time on reviewing and more on coding.  
You are **never** allowed to merge your own pull request this to ensure good quality code.  
And **NEVER** think oh he/she wrote this code it will be fine. You never know what you will find!
